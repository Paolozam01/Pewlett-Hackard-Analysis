# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to help Bobby develop different tables which would help managment prepare for the "silver tsunami". A lot of employees are close to retiring whithin the company and it would be helpful to know which positions are going to be needing a replacement. Because of this bobby was asked to create two important tables. The first one will indicate the number of retiring employees per title and the second one will indicate employees that are eligible to be part of a mentorship program for future employees. 

## Results:

4 major points form the analysis:

* A very large number of titles are eligible to retire at any given time, specially senior engineers and seniors staff. 
* Only 1940 employees are eligible for the mentorship program. 
* Due to the small amount of eligible employees for the mentroship program, each mentor would have to be in charge of around 47 employees, which is not sustainable. 
* The company will have to employ a lot of personal soon since they could have a lot of vacancies at any given moment. 

## Summary:

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?



### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
