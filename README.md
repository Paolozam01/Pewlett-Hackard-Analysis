# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to help Bobby develop different tables which would help managment prepare for the "silver tsunami". A lot of employees are close to retiring whithin the company and it would be helpful to know which positions are going to be needing a replacement. Because of this bobby was asked to create two important tables. The first one will indicate the number of retiring employees per title and the second one will indicate employees that are eligible to be part of a mentorship program for future employees. 

## Results:

4 major points form the analysis:

* A very large number of titles are eligible to retire at any given time, specially senior engineers and seniors staff. 
* Only 1940 employees are eligible for the mentorship program. 
* Due to the small amount of eligible employees for the mentroship program, each mentor would have to be in charge of around 47 employees, which is not sustainable. 
* The company will have to employ a lot of personal soon since they could have a lot of vacancies at any given moment.

## Summary:

High-level responses to the following questions regarding the "silver tsunami":

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

After adding all the eligible employees to retire, the total numer of roles that will need to be filled is 90,398. This number is very big and the company will need to start employing new personel if they don't want to have vacancy problems in the near future. 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Regarding the mentorship project, the number of eligible employees is of 1,940. Considering the number of eligible mentorship employees and the amount of new roles that will be vacant, each mentor would have to be in charge of around 47 employees. This is a very large number of employees for a mentor. The company should consider this before continuing with the mentoring project.
